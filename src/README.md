# **Source Code (`src/`) Folder**

This folder contains the core Python modules for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## **Contents**
1. **`data_preprocessing.py`**:
   - Functions for generating light curves, computing power spectral density (PSD), and calculating FliPer values.

2. **`model_training.py`**:
   - Implements a Random Forest model for star classification.
   - Includes functionality to preprocess data, train models, evaluate performance, and save trained models.

3. **`neural_network_model.py`**:
   - Contains the implementation of a neural network (MLP) for star classification.
   - Includes preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation functions.

## **Purpose**
The scripts in this folder are modular and reusable, enabling efficient data processing and model development pipelines.
