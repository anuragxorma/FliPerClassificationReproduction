# **Models Folder**

This folder contains the trained machine learning models used for star classification.

## **Contents**
1. **`random_forest.pkl`**:
   - The saved Random Forest classifier trained on the processed dataset.
   - Format: `.pkl` (Pickle file).

2. **`neural_network_classifier.keras`**:
   - The saved neural network (MLP) model trained on the processed dataset.
   - Format: `.keras` (TensorFlow model format).

## **Purpose**
The models in this folder can be loaded and used for predictions or further analysis. These serve as the final outputs of the training pipeline.
